# CS370

The objective of the Treasure Hunter project was to take a set of code that creates a maze with the objective of the pirate going from one space to the treasure in another space. The code I had to create taught the AI agent of the program how to complete the maze as efficiently as possible using machine learning.
Computer Scientists design, develop, and implement software systems that empower all of the electronic devices and systems we see and use every day. The work that they do matters because they advance technology in every field in the world, increasing efficiency and capabilities in fields from mobile applications, to airplane navigation systems and mechanical health surgery machines.
Computer scientists approach problems through a iterative process:
- Define the problem: Clearly understand the issue you're trying to solve.
- Break it down: Decompose the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
- Research and analyze: Look for existing solutions or similar problems and their solutions.
- Design a solution: Develop an algorithm (step-by-step instructions) to solve the problem.
- Implement the solution: Translate your algorithm into code using a programming language.
- Test and validate: Thoroughly test your solution and refine it to ensure it works correctly and efficiently.

The ethical responsibilities of computer scientists are vast. Especially, they must protect the data of their users, and protect the interests of the organizations they are developing for.
